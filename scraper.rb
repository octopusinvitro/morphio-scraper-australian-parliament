# # Write out to the sqlite database using scraperwiki library
# ScraperWiki.save_sqlite(["name"], {"name" => "susan", "occupation" => "software developer"})

# # An arbitrary query against the database
# ScraperWiki.select("* from data where 'name'='peter'")

# You don't have to do things with the Mechanize or ScraperWiki libraries.
# You can use whatever gems you want: https://morph.io/documentation/ruby
# All that matters is that your final data is written to an SQLite database
# called "data.sqlite" in the current working directory which has at least a table
# called "data".
